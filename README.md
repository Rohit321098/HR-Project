# HR-Project: Employee Retention

1. In this Power BI project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the key factors influencing employee retention within an organization. 
2. The project involved gathering data on various critical aspects such as employee demographics, job satisfaction levels, performance metrics, and other pertinent variables like tenure, department, and compensation.
3. By visualizing and interpreting these data points, I aimed to uncover underlying trends and patterns that contribute to employee turnover.
4. The dashboards provide actionable insights into which groups are at higher risk of attrition, the correlation between job satisfaction and retention rates, and how performance impacts employee tenure.
5. This project not only highlights areas requiring attention but also assists in developing strategies for improving employee engagement and retention, ultimately enhancing the organization's overall human capital management.
